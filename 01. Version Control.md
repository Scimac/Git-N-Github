## Introduction to Version Control

- Version control serves as a **time machine** for developers, allowing them to track changes in their codebase over time.
- Also known as **source control** or **source code management**.

### Primary Goal of Version Control

   - Records all changes and modifications to files for tracking purposes.
   - Provides access to the entire change history, allowing developers to revert to previous states or points in time.

### Types of Changes

   - Adding new files, modifying or updating files, and deleting files.

### Benefits of Version Control for Developers

   - Revision history for tracking all changes.
	   - Provides a record of all changes, aiding in code stability and bug resolution.
	   - Teams can revert to stable points and work with confidence.
   - Identity tracking for knowing who made each change.
   - Collaboration support for team projects.
	   - Peer reviews allow code inspection and feedback from other team members.
   - Version control is integral to DevOps, aiding in tracking changes, ensuring software quality, and supporting deployments.
   - Version control supports agile methodologies by aiding in planning, execution, and tracking tasks during iterations

### Version Control at Meta

- **Meta** uses a giant **monolithic repository** for all back-end code at Instagram.
- Any engineer can propose changes, emphasizing collective responsibility.
- Different from other companies with micro-services, Meta's approach minimizes merge conflicts.

### Collaboration Challenges

- Monolithic repository leads to frequent merge conflicts; mitigated by writing smaller, reversible changes.
- Gatekeepers and thorough testing ensure easy rollback options when deploying changes to production.
- Collaboration extends to sharing code with Messenger calling, requiring additional testing.
