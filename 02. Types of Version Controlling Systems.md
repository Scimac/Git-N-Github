## Types of Version Control Systems

### Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)

- Contains a server and client architecture.
- The server hosts the main repository with the full history of the code.
- Developers need to pull down the code from the server to their local machine.
- Changes made by developers are pushed back to the central server for visibility to others.
- Requires a constant connection to the server for operations and viewing the history.
- Advantages:
	 - Considered easier to learn.
	 - Provides more access controls to users.
- Disadvantages:
	 - Can be slower due to the need for constant server connections.

### Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)

- Similar to the centralized model but with a fundamental difference.
- Every user is essentially a server, not just a client.
- Users have the entire history of changes on their local system after pulling code.
- Users can work offline, only connecting to the server to pull or push changes.
- Offers improved speed and performance compared to CVCS.
- Advantages:
	 - Users don't need a constant connection to perform actions.
	 - Allows offline work and provides better speed and performance.
	 - Key in improving developer operations and the software development life cycle.


As an aspiring developer, understanding the differences between centralized and distributed version control systems is crucial.

## Historical Evolution of Version Control

- Version control has a history dating back to the 1980s, predating the Internet.
- One of the first significant Version Control Systems was the **Concurrent Versions System (CVS)**, developed in 1986 by Walter F. Tichy at Purdue University and publicly released in 1990.
- CVS stored information about files and folders, but it had flaws like lacking integrity checks and being more suited for text files than binary files.

### Successor to CVS: Subversion (SVN)

- CollabNet developed **Subversion** in 2000 as a successor to CVS, addressing its limitations.
- Subversion included integrity checks and improved support for versioning binary files.
- It gained popularity in the open-source community, with free hosting provided for open-source projects by Google and SourceForge.
- Subversion, however, followed a [[#Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)|CVCS]] model, requiring all operations to be done through a centralized server.

### Rise of Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)

- In 2005, **Mercurial** and **Git** emerged as responses to the Linux kernel development controversy involving the revocation of the BitKeeper license.
- **Mercurial**, developed by Olivia Mackall, offered high-performance distributed version control.
- **Git**, created by Linus Torvalds for hosting the Linux kernel's source code, had its first public release in 2007.
- Git became popular in the open-source community, notably due to its distributed design and free hosting on **Github** for open-source projects.

Understanding the evolution of version control systems provides insight into the challenges they addressed and the progression toward more efficient and distributed models.
