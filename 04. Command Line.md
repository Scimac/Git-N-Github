## Understanding Computer Interaction

Within the computing context, interaction denotes the exchange and processing of information between the user and the computer.

### Input and Output Devices

- Computers utilize a range of input and output devices, encompassing keyboards, mice, microphones, cameras, speakers, monitors, headsets, and haptic devices. 
- Despite the prevalence of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that enhance user-friendliness, these interfaces have limitations in expanding the scope of human-computer interaction.

### Command Line Empowerment

- As a robust alternative to GUIs and traditional input devices, the command line presents itself. 
- While it comes with a steeper learning curve, the command line promises quicker task execution, reduced errors, and advanced capabilities.

## Command Line Capabilities

### Bash Commands

#### Navigation Commands

1. **cd (Change Directory):** Move between directories.
   - Example: `cd Documents` navigates to the "Documents" directory.

2. **ls (List):** Display contents of the current directory.
   - Example: `ls -a` lists all files, including hidden ones.

3. **pwd (Print Working Directory):** Display the full path of the current directory.
   - Example: `pwd` returns the absolute path.

#### File Manipulation Commands

4. **rm (Remove):** Delete a file or directory.
   - Example: `rm file.txt` removes the file.

5. **mv (Move):** Move files or directories to another location.
   - Example: `mv file.txt /new/location` moves the file.

6. **touch:** Create a new empty file or update a timestamp.
   - Example: `touch newfile.txt` creates a new file.

7. **cp (Copy):** Duplicate a file or directory.
   - Example: `cp file.txt copy_file.txt` copies the file.

8. **mkdir (Make Directory):** Create a new directory.
   - Example: `mkdir new_directory` creates a new folder.

9. **cat:** Display content of a file.
   - Example: `cat file.txt` shows the content.

10. **less:** Display file contents one page at a time.
    - Example: `less large_file.txt` pages through the file.

11. **grep:** Search contents of files or folders for patterns.
    - Example: `grep "pattern" file.txt` finds the specified pattern.

#### Additional Unix Commands

12. **chmod (Change Mode):** Modify file permissions.
    - Example: `chmod 755 script.sh` makes a script executable.

13. **chown (Change Owner):** Change file ownership.
    - Example: `chown user:group file.txt` changes ownership.

14. **ps (Process Status):** Display information about active processes.
    - Example: `ps aux` shows detailed process information.

15. **kill:** Terminate a process by process ID (PID).
    - Example: `kill -9 PID` forcefully terminates the process.

16. **df (Disk Free):** Display disk space usage.
    - Example: `df -h` shows human-readable disk usage.
	

### Flags
- Every command has flags to modify its output. Example: `ls -l` displays detailed information.

### Pipes
- **Understanding Pipes (`|`):**    
    - Execute the following command: `ls | wc -w`.
	- Observe how the `ls` command lists files, and its output is fed into the `wc -w` command, counting the number of words in that list.

- **Combining Commands with Pipes:**
    - Combine the `cat` command with pipes to process content from multiple files.
	- Execute: `cat file1.txt file2.txt | wc -w`.
	- Witness how the content of both `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` is combined and then passed to `wc -w` for word count.

### Redirection

Redirection enables the alteration of standard input and/or output, providing greater control over command-line operations. IN Unix there are three types of input/output redirections: **standard input, standard output, and standard error**.
#### Standard Input, Output, and Error
The shell employs a numbering system to reference standard input, output, and error:
- 0: Standard Input
- 1: Standard Output
- 2: Standard Error

#### Redirection Types

1. **Standard Input (stdin)**
	- The `<` symbol is used to redirect standard input.
	- Example: Using `cat` to record user input to a file named `input.txt`.
	   ```bash
	   cat > input.txt
	   ```
	   - Enter text, and use `Ctrl + D` to signal the end of the input.
	   - Display the content using `cat < input.txt`.

2. **Standard Output (stdout)**
	- The `>` symbol is employed for output redirection.
	- Example: Redirecting the output of the `ls -l` command to a file named `output.txt`.
	   ```bash
	   ls -l > output.txt
	   ```
	   - View the content using `cat output.txt`.

3. **Standard Error (stderr)**
	- The `2>` symbol is used to redirect standard error.
	- Example: Handling errors and output simultaneously, storing errors in `error.txt`. `/bin/usr` directory does not exist!
	   ```bash
	   ls -l /bin/usr 2> error.txt
	   ```
	- View errors using `less error.txt`.
	- Example: Combining output and errors in a single file (`error_output.txt`).
	   ```bash
	   ls -l /bin/ > error_output.txt 2>&1
	   ```
	   - View the log using `less error_output.txt`.

### Grep

**Grep**, short for **Global Regular Expression Print**, is a powerful command-line tool used for searching patterns across files and folders, as well as within the contents of files.
#### Basic Grep Usage

1. **Standard Search**
	- Conduct a standard search for names starting with "Sam" in the file `names.txt`.  
	```bash
	grep Sam names.txt
	```
	- Returns a list of names beginning with "Sam."

2. **Case Sensitivity**
	- Grep is case-sensitive, so a search for "sam" would yield different results.
	```bash
	grep sam names.txt
	```
	- Returns partial matches with "Sam" in the middle or end of a name.

3. **Case-Insensitive Search**
	- Use the `-i` flag to ignore case sensitivity.
	```bash
	grep -i Sam names.txt
	```
	- Returns matches regardless of case, capturing both "Sam" and partial matches.

4.  **Exact Match**
	- The `-w` flag ensures an exact match, ignoring partial matches.
	```bash
	grep -w Sam names.txt
	```
	- Returns only the exact match for "Sam."

#### Advanced Grep Usage

1. **Combining Grep with Other Commands**
	- Utilize pipes (`|`) to combine Grep with other commands. Example: Searching for executable files with "zip" in the `/bin` directory.
	```bash
	ls /bin | grep zip
	```
	- Filters executable files in `/bin` containing the keyword "zip."

2. **Refining Searches**
	- Apply different flags to refine searches further based on specific requirements.
	- Experiment with `-i` for case insensitivity, `-w` for exact matches, and other flags as needed.

3. Regular Expressions
	- Grep uses regular expressions to define search patterns, offering flexibility in pattern matching.

4. **Multiple Keywords**
	- Grep can search for multiple keywords simultaneously, enhancing search capabilities.

### Man Pages
- Manual pages (`man`) provide detailed information and options for each command.

### Editing Files
- Common editor: VI or Vim (Visual Editor Improved).
- Modes: Normal mode, Insert mode, Command line mode.


The command line provides a more advanced level of interaction with computers, enabling users to perform a diverse array of tasks efficiently.
