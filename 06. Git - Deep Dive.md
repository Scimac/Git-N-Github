### What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that efficiently manages projects of all sizes. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to address the collaboration challenges he faced while developing the Linux kernel.
### Key Concepts in Git

#### Repository (Repo)

A repository is a storage space where your project's entire history, files, and directories are stored. It exists on your local machine and can be mirrored on remote servers like GitHub.

#### Commit

A commit represents a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It includes changes made to files, comments explaining those changes, and a unique identifier.

#### Branch

A branch is an independent line of development, allowing you to work on a specific feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase. Branches can be merged back into the main branch when the changes are ready.

#### Merge

Merging combines changes from different branches into a single branch, typically the main branch. It integrates the changes while preserving the commit history.

#### Pull Request

A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository. It enables contributors to notify others about the changes they've made and request review and merging.

#### Installing Git

Before using Git, you need to install it on your machine. Visit the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/) for installation instructions based on your operating system.
#### Gitignore

The `.gitignore` file specifies intentionally untracked files and paths to be ignored by Git. Create a `.gitignore` file and add patterns for files or directories you want to ignore.

### Basic Git Commands

#### Initializing a Repository

To start using Git, you need to initialize a new repository:
```bash
git init
```
This command creates a new Git repository in the current directory.

#### Cloning a Repository

To clone an existing repository from a remote source (e.g., GitHub):
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
#### Checking Repository Status

To view the status of your repository and changes made:
```bash
git status
```
#### Staging Changes

To stage changes for commit:
```bash
git add <file_name>
```
Use `git add .` to stage all changes.

#### Committing Changes

To commit staged changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
#### Viewing Commit History

To view the commit history:
```bash
git log
```
#### Creating a Branch

To create a new branch:
```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```
#### Switching Between Branches

To switch to a different branch:
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```
#### Merging Branches

To merge changes from one branch into another:
```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```
#### Pulling Changes

To pull changes from a remote repository:
```bash
git pull origin <branch_name>
```
#### Pushing Changes

To push changes to a remote repository:
```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

### Intermediate Git Concepts

#### Remote Repositories

Git allows you to connect your local repository to a remote repository, typically hosted on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

#### Adding a Remote

To add a remote repository:
```bash
git remote add <remote_name> <repository_url>
```

#### Fetching Changes from Remote

To fetch changes from a remote repository:
```bash
git fetch <remote_name>
```

#### Creating a Branch on Remote

To create a new branch on a remote repository:
```bash
git push <remote_name> <branch_name>
```

#### Resolving Merge Conflicts

When Git encounters conflicting changes in different branches, it creates a merge conflict. Resolving conflicts involves manually choosing which changes to keep.

#### Checking for Conflicts

```bash
git status
```

#### Viewing Conflicts

```bash
git diff
```

#### Marking Conflicts as Resolved

After manually resolving conflicts, mark them as resolved:
```bash
git add <file_name>
```

#### Undoing Changes

Git provides several ways to undo changes, depending on the stage of the process.

#### Discarding Unstaged Changes

```bash
git checkout -- <file_name>
```

#### Discarding Staged Changes

```bash
git reset HEAD <file_name>
```

#### Reverting a Commit

```bash
git revert <commit_sha>
```

### Advanced Git Concepts

#### Git Branching Strategies

Effective branching strategies enhance collaboration and code stability. Popular strategies include:

- **Feature Branching:**  
	**Overview:**
	- Each new feature or task is developed in a dedicated branch.
	- Feature branches are created from the main branch.
	- After completing the feature, changes are merged back into the main branch.
	
	**Workflow:**
	1. Create a new feature branch:
	   ```bash
	   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
	   ```
	2. Work on the feature and commit changes:
	   ```bash
	   git add .
	   git commit -m "Implement new feature"
	   ```
	3. Merge the feature branch back into the main branch:
	   ```bash
	   git checkout main
	   git merge feature/new-feature
	   ```

- **Gitflow Workflow:** 
	**Overview:**
	- A branching model that defines a strict branching structure, including feature branches, release branches, and a main branch.
	- Defines a strict branching model with specific branch purposes.
	- Includes branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.
	- Encourages a structured release process.
	
	**Branches in Gitflow:**
	- **Main Branch (`master`):** Represents the production-ready code.
	- **Develop Branch (`develop`):** Ongoing work for the next release.
	- **Feature Branches (`feature/feature-name`):** Developed features.
	- **Release Branches (`release/release-version`):** Preparing for a new release.
	- **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/hotfix-name`):** Emergency fixes for the production code.
	
- **GitHub Flow:** 
	**Overview:**
	- Emphasizes continuous delivery by maintaining a single main branch and creating feature branches as needed.
	- Emphasizes continuous delivery.
	- Maintains a single main branch (often named `main` or `master`).
	- Feature development occurs in feature branches.
	
	**Workflow:**
	1. Create a new feature branch:
	   ```bash
	   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
	   ```
	2. Work on the feature and commit changes.
	3. Open a pull request (PR) for code review and discussion.
	4. Merge the feature branch into the main branch after approval.
	5. Deploy changes to production.

#### Rebasing

Rebasing is an alternative to merging and involves moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It creates a linear commit history.

To perform an interactive rebase:
```bash
git rebase -i <commit_sha>
```

##### Rebasing a Feature Branch

**Scenario:**
- You have a feature branch with multiple commits, and you want to squash them into a single commit before merging into the main branch.

**Steps:**
1. Switch to the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/my-feature
   ```
2. Start an interactive rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i main
   ```
3. In the interactive rebase screen, mark commits for squashing (change "pick" to "squash").
4. Save and close the file.
5. In the next screen, edit the commit messages if needed.
6. Save and close the file to complete the rebase.

##### Editing Commits

**Scenario:**
- You need to edit a specific commit, e.g., fixing a typo in the commit message or changing code.

**Steps:**
1. Start an interactive rebase at the commit preceding the one you want to edit:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Replace 3 with the number of commits to go back
   ```
2. In the interactive rebase screen, change "pick" to "edit" for the commit to be modified.
3. Save and close the file.
4. Make the necessary changes (e.g., edit files or commit messages).
5. Stage the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
6. Amend the commit:
   ```bash
   git commit --amend
   ```
7. Continue with the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

##### Squashing Commits

**Scenario:**
- You want to combine multiple

 commits into a single commit.

**Steps:**
1. Start an interactive rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i main
   ```
2. In the interactive rebase screen, mark commits for squashing.
3. Save and close the file.
4. In the next screen, edit the commit messages if needed.
5. Save and close the file to complete the rebase.

#### Git Hooks

Git hooks are scripts triggered at specific points in the Git workflow, such as pre-commit or post-merge. They allow custom actions to be performed automatically.
##### Creating a Git Hook

Create a file in the `.git/hooks/` directory (e.g., `.git/hooks/pre-commit`) and make it executable.
##### Creating Custom Hooks

**Scenario:**
- You want to create a pre-commit hook to run linting checks before each commit.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the `.git/hooks/` directory within your repository.
2. Create a new file (e.g., `pre-commit`).
3. Make the file executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x pre-commit
   ```
4. Edit the script using your preferred text editor.

##### Example: Pre-Commit Hook

**Objective:**
- Run linting checks using a tool like ESLint before each commit.

**Sample `pre-commit` Hook Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Run ESLint
eslint .
```

**Explanation:**
- This simple hook script runs ESLint on all files in the repository before allowing a commit. If ESLint reports errors, the commit is prevented.

#### Submodules

Git submodules allow you to include other Git repositories within your own. They are useful for managing dependencies.

##### Adding a Submodule

**Scenario:**
- You want to add an external library (e.g., a utility library) as a submodule in your project.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the root of your Git repository.
2. Add the submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule add <repository_url> <destination_path>
   ```
3. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add submodule: <submodule_name>"
   ```
##### Updating Submodules

**Scenario:**
- The external library (submodule) has been updated, and you want to fetch the latest changes.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the root of your Git repository.
2. Update submodules:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --remote
   ```
3. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Update submodules"
   ```

#### Git Worktrees

Git worktrees enable you to work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching between them.
##### Creating a Worktree

**Scenario:**
- You are working on a feature branch, and you need to address a critical bug in the main branch without losing your feature branch changes.

**Steps:**
1. Create a new worktree:
   ```bash
   git worktree add <path> <branch_name>
   ```
2. Navigate to the new worktree:
   ```bash
   cd <path>
   ```

##### Switching Between Worktrees

**Scenario:**
- You have multiple worktrees, and you need to switch between them.

**Steps:**
1. List available worktrees:
   ```bash
   git worktree list
   ```
2. Navigate to a specific worktree:
   ```bash
   cd <path>
   ```

#### Git Stash

Git stash allows you to save changes that are not ready to be committed, giving you a clean working directory to switch branches or perform other tasks.

##### Stashing Changes

**Scenario:**
- You are working on a feature but need to switch to another branch to address a critical bug.

**Steps:**
1. Stash changes:
   ```bash
   git stash save "Your stash message"
   ```

##### Applying Stashed Changes

**Scenario:**
- You've addressed the critical bug in another branch and want to apply your stashed changes back to the feature branch.

**Steps:**
1. Apply stashed changes:
   ```bash
   git stash apply
   ```


#### Git Cherry-Pick

Cherry-picking allows you to apply specific commits from one branch to another.

##### Cherry-Picking a Commit

**Scenario:**
- You want to apply a specific commit from another branch to your current branch.

**Steps:**
1. Identify the commit you want to cherry-pick (commit SHA).
2. Switch to the target branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout <target_branch>
   ```
3. Cherry-pick the commit:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit_sha>
   ```

##### Cherry-Picking Range of Commits

**Scenario:**
- You want to apply a range of sequential commits from another branch to your current branch.

**Steps:**
1. Identify the starting and ending commit in the range.
2. Switch to the target branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout <target_branch>
   ```
3. Cherry-pick the range of commits:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <start_commit>^..<end_commit>
   ```
